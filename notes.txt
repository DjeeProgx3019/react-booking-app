Creating a react application:
	Syntax: 
		npx create-react-app <project-name>

Delete unnecessary files from the newly created project:
Application > src
- App.test.js
- index.css
- logo.svg
- reportWebVitals.js

Remove the importation of the deleted files:
Application > src > index.js
 - index.css
 - reportWebVitals.js (including reportWebVitals())

Application > src > App.js
 - logo.svg
 - elements under <div> tag

Install the JavaScript (Babel) Linting for code readability.
Sublime Text Editor

	1. Open Command Palette

	Linux and Windows
	Ctrl + Shift + P
	MacOS
	Cmd + Shift + P

	2. In the input field type the word "install" and select the "Package Control: Install Package" option to trigger an installation of an add-on feature for sublime text editor.

	3. Type "babel" in the input field to search for the "Babel" linting to be installed.

	4. Change the linting of the sublime text editor to "Javascript(Babel)" (Bottom right corner of the screen.)

ReactJS components
- This are reusable parts of our react app.
- The are independent UI parts of our app.
- Components are functions that return react element.
- Components naming convetion: PascalCase
	- Captilized letters for all words of the function name and file name associated with it.

Rendering vs Mounting
- "Rendering" refers to the process of calling/invoking  a component returning a set of instructions for creating DOM.
- "Mounting" it is when React JS "renders" or display the component and builds the initial DOM based on the instruction.

Import Rules:
- It's also good practice to organize importing of modules to improve code readability.
- The example above follows the following pattern:
	- imports from built-in react modules
	- imports from downloaded packages
	- imports from user defined components
